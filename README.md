Repository for exploring the use of AI in `miRNA` research.

Specifically to find the *most* deregulated species of `miRNA` from two different measurements. 

First measurement is a base-line sample from sedentary university students. The second measurement is a sample from the same students, but 0.5 years after they where provided with a personal trainer to do moderate regular exercise. Around 780 species where measured, but only the 50 most  deregulated species were chosen.
