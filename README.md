# Roald
Repository for exploring the use of AI in `miRNA` research.

---

Specifically to find the *most* deregulated species of `miRNA` from two different measurements. 

First measurement is a base-line sample from sedentary university students. The second measurement is a sample from the same students, but `0.5` years after they where provided with a personal trainer to do moderate regular exercise. Around `780` species where measured, but only around `50` of the most deregulated species were chosen to be included in this dataset.
